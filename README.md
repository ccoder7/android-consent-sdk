# Consent SDK for Android

Obtaining explicit user consent with gathering analytics data in an app, or with processing user’s personal data is important part of establishing user trust and seamless user experience.

Although implementing some dialog to obtain user consents and store them for further reference seems pretty straightforward, digging into it reveals (as usual with “simple tasks”) many programming and design details that must be implemented, which are not the core functionality of your app.

So why not use or reuse some ready-made SDK?
